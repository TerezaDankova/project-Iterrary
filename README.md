# project-Iterrary
Final front-end project
<br/>
ABOUT: 
<br/>
Project called Iterrary, which the main idea is to bring together more people who loves Italy like I do, by creating a platform where you can find an inspiration for your next trips, and because we talk about Italy, thanks to Google map API and Trip Advisor API, you can also reach out some good restaurant near to you or in the city you would like to visit. The idea of full project is to have full functional itinerary page, where people can log in and talk about their experiences, they can find here also an interested recipes and so they can get inspired by the Italian cuisine and just chat about Italy.
